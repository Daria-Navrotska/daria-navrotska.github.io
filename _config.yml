  Data Analyst 
  <br><br>
  Passionate about transforming complex data into valuable insights. Following
  the completion of my PhD and contribution to biotech research, I transitioned into data 
  analytics to implement my strengths in structured problem‑solving. I possess extensive 
  proficiency in Python, SQL, interactive dashboards, machine learning and effective 
  communication with a range of stakeholders. I am particularly interested in opportunities
  that allow to apply my analytical expertise and support informed decision‑making.
