# Planning for Influenza Season in the U.S.A.

## Project Goal
Enable a U.S.A. medical staffing agency to anticipate influenza‑related surges and allocate temporary healthcare workers across all country. The analysis focuses on identifying flu trends and highlighting states with large vulnerable populations to ensure timely support for those at highest risk.

## Objectives
-Identify vulnerable population groups and high‑risk states.
-Analyze U.S. flu mortality trends from 2009-2017.
-Identify peak periods requiring additional medical  staffing.
-Create a data‑informed strategy for allocating medical personnel.
-Present actionable insights to support strategic resource planning.

## Data:
CDC Influenza Deaths dataset
Population data (US Census)
Survey of influenza test results (CDC)
Survey of flu shot rates in children (CDC)

## Scope
- Analyze historical flu mortality data (2009-2017)
- Identify high-risk states and vulnerable populations
- Determine optimal timing for staff deployment
- Develop data-driven staffing allocation strategy
- Provide actionable recommendations for resource planning

## Tools:
Excel
Tableau
Hypothesis testing 
Storytelling

## Skills:
-Data cleaning, aggregation, and integration.
-Spatial and temporal visualizations.
-Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis.
-Presenting insights and recommendations to stakeholders.
-Reporting.

## Methodological Approach
# Data Preparation
-Defined key data questions and research plan.
-Formulated a research hypothesis to guide the analysis.
-Identified available datasets: their relevance, limitations, and integrity.
-Created detailed data profiles covering data types, accuracy, consistency, completeness, uniqueness.
-Cleaned and standardized the datasets, addressing missing values and quality.
-Transformed and integrated data from multiple sources into a single dataset.

# Analysis
-Calculated descriptive statistics, including variance and standard deviation for key variables.
-Explored relationships through correlation analysis.
-Conducted hypothesis testing and interpreted significance
-Built exploratory visualizations and connected the dataset to Tableau.

# Results 
-Summarized analytical findings in an interim report.
-Developed a Tableau storyboard highlighting trends, forecasts, and patterns.
-Delivered a clear narrative and presentation of insights for stakeholders.
