    <p>
      This project analyzes CDC mortality data from 2009–2017 to identify when and where demand is likely to peak. By evaluating both total deaths and per-capita mortality rates, I pinpointed high-priority states and recommended a phased regional deployment strategy aligned with seasonal flu patterns. The findings were visualized in a Tableau storyboard.
